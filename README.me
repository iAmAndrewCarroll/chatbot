First I need to make an intents.json file that helps train the chatbot based on inputs.  This basically becomes the training data for the chatbot.

Example:
```
"intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greetings",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "How are you", "Is anyone there?", "Hello", "Good day", "What's up", "What's good", "how's it going"],
      "responses": ["Hello!", "Good to see you again!", "Hi there, how can I help?", "What's good my dude?"]
    },
```
